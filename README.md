HOW IT WORKS
Need to buy a used textbook? No problem. 
Search for it and then contact the seller. 
Can’t find the used book you need? 
That’s no problem either. 
We’ll give you a price comparison and tell you where you can get the cheapest textbooks!

We’ll save you the hassle of having to look on a whole bunch of bookselling websites on your own to find cheap college textbooks. 
Who really knows where to look anyway? We do, that’s who. 
We’ve got a huge network of booksellers, and we’ll cut through the clutter for you and find you a place to get those discount books for a great deal.

Need to sell textbooks? Great! Just create an account, enter the book’s info, and sell away.
Meet up on campus to do the deal.
No fees, no shipping, and no credit cards. What else do you need?

Celebrate all the money you’ve saved on cheap textbooks by spending it on something way more fun… might we suggest… you know it without us saying it...
